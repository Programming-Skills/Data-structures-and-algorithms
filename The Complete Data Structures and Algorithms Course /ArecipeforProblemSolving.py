# 1. Understand the Problem

### Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum ###

# i. Can we restate the problem in our own words?

# Implement addition

# ii. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

# int, float or something else?

# iii. What are the outputs that come from the problem?

# int, float or something else?

# iv. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? 
# In other words do we have enough information to solve this problem?

# Yes

# v. How should I label the important piece of data that are part of the 
# problem?

# Add, Sum

# 2. Explore Examples

### Write a function which takes in a string and returns a count of each character in the string ###

# i. Start with simple examples

# charCount('bbbb')
# {b : 4}

# charCount('hello')
# {h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o:1}

# ii. Progress to more complex examples

# charCount("My name is Martin")

# iii. Explore examples with empty 

# charCount("")

# iv. Explore the examples with invalid inputs

# charCount(1)

# 3. Break it Down

### Write a function that which takes in a string and returns a count of each character in the string ###

# charCount("My name is Martin")

# {m:3,
#  y:1,
#  n:2,
#  a:2,
#  e:1,
#  i:2,
#  s:1,
#  r:1,
#  t:1}

def charCount(strn):
    # do something 
    # - declare an object to return at the end 
    # - loop over the string
       # if the char is a letter and it is in our object add one to the value
       # if the char is a letter and it's not in our object add that char to our object with the value of one. 
    # return something - return an object
    pass

# 4. Solve and Simplify

# 5. Look Back and Refactor
